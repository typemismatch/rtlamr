### Note - This Fork modifies the core functionality to now work with AWS IoT.
### AWS IoT Usage
You will need to setup a thing certificate and private key for this to run.
Using AWS Analytics you can now graph your incoming data. Details below.
### Purpose
Utilities often use "smart meters" to optimize their residential meter reading infrastructure. Smart meters transmit consumption information in the various ISM bands allowing utilities to simply send readers driving through neighborhoods to collect commodity consumption information. One protocol in particular: Encoder Receiver Transmitter by Itron is fairly straight forward to decode and operates in the 900MHz ISM band, well within the tunable range of inexpensive rtl-sdr dongles.

This project is a software defined radio receiver for these messages. We make use of an inexpensive rtl-sdr dongle to allow users to non-invasively record and analyze the commodity consumption of their household.

There's now experimental support for data collection and aggregation with [rtlamr-collect](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr-collect)!

### Requirements
 * GoLang >=1.3 (Go build environment setup guide: http://golang.org/doc/code.html)
 * rtl-sdr
   * Windows: [pre-built binaries](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/attachment/wiki/rtl-sdr/RelWithDebInfo.zip)
   * Linux: [source and build instructions](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

### Building
This project requires the package [`github.com/bemasher/rtltcp`](http://godoc.org/github.com/bemasher/rtltcp), which provides a means of controlling and sampling from rtl-sdr dongles via the `rtl_tcp` tool. This package will be automatically downloaded and installed when getting rtlamr. The following command should be all that is required to install rtlamr.

	go get github.com/typemismatch/rtlamr

This will install a binary in your $HOME/go/bin folder however you will need to first provide certificate information. Instead of running
that binary do the following:

cd /src/github.com/typemismatch/rtlamr

You will see a rootCA.pem file required for connecting to AWS IoT.
Create a new thing and save your certificate and private key file here as

* rtlsdr.certificate.crt
* rtlsdr.private.key

The default region is us-west-2, you can change this in main.go to match the region your certificate is created in.

Finally do
```bash
go build
```

./rtlamr

You should have MQTT messages streaming to AWS IoT.

### AWS IoT Analytics
You will need to have access to this service which is currently in preview.

The dafault topic that we'll be capturing data on is /rtlsdr.

Follow these steps to get started:

* Setup a new channel in Analytics with a topic filter for `/rtlsdr`
* Setup a new datastore in Analytics.
* Setup a new pipeline and use the rtlsdr_model.json file under /models to select message attributes.
* Select a pipeline action to select the fields you want and pass through.
* Setup a new dataset doing a select * from your new datastore and setup a 1 hour cron job.
* Setup a rule in AWS IoT to send messages from /rtlsdr to your channel in Analytics.
* We will need to timestamp our messages for QuickSight, your rule query statement needs to be `SELECT *, parse_time("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ", timestamp()) as RealTime FROM '/rtlsdr'`
* Back in Analytics, select your dataset, select Action and Run Query Now.

You can now go to QuickSight and query your dataset. Make sure your QuickSite is in the same region as your Analytics.

### Usage
Available command-line flags are as follows:

```
Usage of rtlamr:
  -duration=0s: time to run for, 0 for infinite, ex. 1h5m10s
  -filterid=: display only messages matching an id in a comma-separated list of ids.
  -filtertype=: display only messages matching a type in a comma-separated list of types.
  -format=plain: format to write log messages in: plain, csv, json, or xml
  -msgtype=scm: message type to receive: scm, scm+, idm, r900 and r900bcd
  -samplefile=/dev/null: raw signal dump file
  -single=false: one shot execution, if used with -filterid, will wait for exactly one packet from each meter id
  -symbollength=72: symbol length in samples
  -unique=false: suppress duplicate messages from each meter
  -version=false: display build date and commit hash
rtltcp specific:
  -agcmode=false: enable/disable rtl agc
  -centerfreq=0: center frequency to receive on
  -directsampling=false: enable/disable direct sampling
  -freqcorrection=0: frequency correction in ppm
  -gainbyindex=0: set gain by index
  -offsettuning=false: enable/disable offset tuning
  -rtlxtalfreq=0: set rtl xtal frequency
  -samplerate=0: sample rate
  -server=127.0.0.1:1234: address or hostname of rtl_tcp instance
  -testmode=false: enable/disable test mode
  -tunergain=0: set tuner gain in dB
  -tunergainmode=false: enable/disable tuner gain
  -tunerxtalfreq=0: set tuner xtal frequency
```

Flag default values may be overridden via environment variables which are a flag's name in all-caps prefixed by `RTLAMR_`. Flags passed at time of execution will override any values set by environment variable.

```bash
rtlamr -h

...
  -msgtype=scm: message type to receive: scm, scm+, idm, r900 and r900bcd
...
```

```bash
RTLAMR_MSGTYPE=idm rtlamr -h

...
  -msgtype=idm: message type to receive: scm, scm+, idm, r900 and r900bcd
...
```

Running the receiver is as simple as starting an `rtl_tcp` instance and then starting the receiver:

```bash
# Terminal A
$ rtl_tcp

# Terminal B
$ rtlamr
```

If you want to run the spectrum server on a different machine than the receiver you'll want to specify an address to listen on that is accessible from the machine `rtlamr` will run on with the `-a` option for `rtl_tcp` with an address accessible by the system running the receiver.

### Messages
Currently both SCM (Standard Consumption Message) and IDM (Interval Data Message) packets can be decoded but are mutually exclusive, you cannot receive both simultaneously. See [RTLAMR: Protocol](http://bemasher.github.io/rtlamr/protocol.html) for more details on packet structure.

There's now experimental support for meters with R900 transmitters!

### Sensitivity
Using a NooElec NESDR Nano R820T with the provided antenna, I can reliably receive standard consumption messages from ~300 different meters and intermittently from another ~600 meters. These figures are calculated from the number of messages received during a 25 minute window. Reliably in this case means receiving at least 10 of the expected 12 messages and intermittently means 3-9 messages.

### Compatibility
Currently the only tested meter is the Itron C1SR. However, the protocol is designed to be useful for several different commodities and should be capable of receiving messages from any ERT capable smart meter.

Check out the table of meters I've been compiling from various internet sources: [ERT Compatible Meters](https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr/blob/master/meters.md)

If you've got a meter not on the list that you've successfully received messages from, you can submit this info via a form available at the link above.

### Ethics
_Do not use this for nefarious purposes._ If you do, I don't want to know about it, I am not and will not be responsible for your lack of common decency and/or foresight. However, if you find a clever non-evil use for this, by all means, share.

### Use Cases
These are a few examples of ways this tool could be used:

**Ethical**
 * Track down stray appliances.
 * Track power generated vs. power consumed.
 * Find a water leak with rtlamr rather than from your bill.
 * Optimize your thermostat to reduce energy consumption.
 * Mass collection for research purposes. (_Please_ anonymize your data.)

**Unethical**
 * Using data collected to determine living patterns of specific persons with the intent to act on this data, particularly without express permission to do so.
